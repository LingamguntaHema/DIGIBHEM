This repository contains the code and resources for the Iris Flower Classification project, completed as part of my machine learning internship with DIGITALBHEM. The project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species using two popular machine learning algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Decision Trees.

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):
Length of the sepals
Width of the sepals
Length of the petals
Width of the petals.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Steps

    Data Loading and Preprocessing Load the Iris dataset using scikit-learn. Split the data into training and testing sets. Standardize the features to improve algorithm performance.
    Model Training k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): Train a k-NN classifier with k=5. Decision Tree: Train a Decision Tree classifier with default parameters.
    Model Evaluation Calculate accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. Generate confusion matrices and classification reports for detailed model evaluation.
    Data Visualization Create confusion matrix heatmaps for both classifiers. Visualize feature distributions and relationships using pair plots. üìà Results Both the k-NN and Decision Tree classifiers achieved perfect accuracy on the test set, demonstrating their effectiveness on the Iris dataset. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations provide further insights into model performance.
